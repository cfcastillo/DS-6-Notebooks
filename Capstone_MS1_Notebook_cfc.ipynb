        "I have seen a downward trend in college education during my lifetime. College was very important in the 1980's and 1990's and was a requirement for many jobs. Without Internet resources, college was almost exlusively the only means of obtaining higher level education. With the Internet, YouTube&trade; and many online learning resources, information and education outside college is plentiful. As a result, college requirements for employment are declining. More employers are accepting people based on experience or certifications self-taught or through formal channels. So education is still important. What is changing is the mechanism for obtaining that education.\n",

People can perform many tasks from the convenience of their home; work at home, shop at home, learn at home. The Internet has also changed our pace of life. People expect things to happen quickly. People do not want to spend several years and thousands of dollars on a college education if they can get a good job without making those sacrifices. People do not want to wait for public transportation if there are more convenient, affordable options available. People want services tailored to their lives, not the other way around.\n",
