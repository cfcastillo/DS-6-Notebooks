In other words, colleges are likely to expand tuition rates in order to consume the \"free money\" that students receive from the government. The idea is that this is similar to doctors' offices billing insurance companies more than they would bill a self-pay patient; going where the big pockets are.\n",

If indeed colleges are increasing tuition to get more government money, then this research might help lower the cost of tuition by encouraging colleges to base tuition on actual costs rather than available funding."
