Therefore, we executed 3 matching passes reducing the SOC code by one character each time and pulling the largest Census code for the SOC code prefix. This allowed us to match a larger percentage of the data back to the ASEC data. However, we still had around 50% NULL data so decided to remove the OES data from our final analysis.\n",
