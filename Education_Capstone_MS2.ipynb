However, because 2020 was anomalous due to Covid, we had to go back and take data from 2018 and 2019 - pre-covid to get occupation and salary information that was more stable. Per the above link, the \"*ASEC data is the source of timely official national estimates of poverty levels and rates and of widely used measures of income. It provides annual estimates based on a survey of more than 75,000 households. The survey contains detailed questions covering social and economic characteristics of each person who is a household member as of the interview date.
