        "Over the last 20 years, a downward trend in college education has been observed. College was very important in the 1980's and 1990's and was a requirement for many jobs. Without Internet resources, college was almost exlusively the only means of obtaining higher level education. With the Internet, YouTube&trade; and many online learning resources, information and education outside college is plentiful. Today, more employers are hiring people based on experience or education gained through alternate channels. So education is still important.
